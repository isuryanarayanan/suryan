Yesterday was valentine's day. I had such a horrible headache that I slept from 2 PM to 12 AM. I woke up, had dinner..or lunch as you may call it, and then 
I went for a run 3 in the morning. I drew a dick on strava, you can check it out here `https://strava.app.link/JOWwKkzCZQb`. Now I have made tea, and is ready to get my first round of work done.
I usually work in the morning as its calm and I feel most productive in the morning, away from distractions. I don't listen to music while I work, I prefer the 
silence, but I do wear my headphones so that people won't approach me. Today I feel like organizing, and simplifying my working hours so that I can find time to 
workout every day. I have a few fitness goals that I have been delaying for some time now.
