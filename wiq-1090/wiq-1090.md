# Summary

A WareIQ App is defined by a developer as per the AppStore.md file, however there is a standard for how a WareIQ App is maintained by the system. The cleanup and restructuring of this system is as follows:

The app store revamp has 2 major components

## 1. App Store

App store exposes API's for starting and managing the lifecycle of a WareIQ Application. It handles the following cases:

1. Activation

   1. Trial Activation
   2. Paid Activation

2. Deactivation

   1. Disabling the recurring payment
   2. Deactivating free applications

3. Upgrade

   1. Upgrades the plan of an application instantly

4. Downgrade

   1. Downgrades the plan of a credit based application instantly
   2. Initiates downgrade of the plan of a duration based application.

5. Config

   1. Updates the configuration of a user application

Then there is application specific API's

1. Branded Tracking
2. WareIQ Interact
3. Shipping Badges

## 2. App Engine

App engine makes sure that a life cycle of a WareIQ Application is completed. It handles the following tasks

1. Making sure the app is deactivated if the limits have expired.
2. Making sure the app is renewed if the limits have been breached and the recurring payment option is enabled.

   1. Downgrades an app if a downgrade is initiated for the app.

3. Making sure alerts are sent when an application nears expiry.

   1. 7 days before expiry
   2. 1 day before expiry

4. Making sure alerts are sent when an application has expired.

   1. 7 days after expiry
   2. 2 days after expiry

# Database Migrations

This rework of the app store aims to simplify the current setup of the app store so that, in the next iteration a sub ledger can be used to provide
a more solid billing system for a wareiq app. The following changes are being made to the tables that are concerned with the app store.

## 1. Master Applications

Master Application is a table that holds the necessary information regarding a wareiq application that is offered in the app store. In this current structure there are
some columns which are not meaningful and in the current structure such a column are the Pricing detail columns. If the pricing details are stored inside the json field
for each subscription it is redundant and useless to have `unit_price` and `unit` columns in the table.

Here is the current structure of the application:

```python
    class MasterApplication(db.Model):

        __tablename__ = "master_application"

        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)


        # Content that describes the app for the end user
        app_name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=True)
        thumbnail_url = db.Column(db.String, nullable=True)
        icon_url = db.Column(db.String, nullable=True)
        description = db.Column(db.String, nullable=True)


        # Content that describes the app in the system
        app_key = db.Column(db.String)
        app_type = db.Column(db.String)
        master_configuration = db.Column(JSON)

        # Subscription details
        subscription_1 = db.Column(JSON)
        subscription_2 = db.Column(JSON)
        subscription_3 = db.Column(JSON)
        subscription_4 = db.Column(JSON)

        # Pricing details
        unit_price = db.Column(db.FLOAT, nullable=True)
        unit = db.Column(db.String)

        date_created = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.now)
        date_updated = db.Column(db.DateTime, onupdate=datetime.now)
```

The new structure of the table will be:

```python
    class MasterApplication(db.Model):

        __tablename__ = "master_application"

        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)

        # Content that describes the app for the end user
        app_name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=True)
        thumbnail_url = db.Column(db.String, nullable=True)
        icon_url = db.Column(db.String, nullable=True)
        description = db.Column(db.String, nullable=True)

        # Content that describes the app in the system
        app_key = db.Column(db.String)
        app_type = db.Column(db.String)
        master_configuration = db.Column(JSON)

        # Subscription details
        subscription_1 = db.Column(JSON)
        subscription_2 = db.Column(JSON)
        subscription_3 = db.Column(JSON)
        subscription_4 = db.Column(JSON)

        date_created = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.now)
        date_updated = db.Column(db.DateTime, onupdate=datetime.now)
```

NOTE:

- `master_configuration` will be used to store the default configuration for the application if any.
- `subscription_1`, `subscription_2`, `subscription_3`, `subscription_4` will be used to store the subscription details for the application in the
  form of a json object. The json object will have the following structure:

  ```json
  {
    "name": "Base",
    "desc": "Covers 2,000 sms communications",
    "price": 700,
    "unit_price": 0.35,
    "total_units": 2000,
    "recurring_days": 30
  }
  ```

## 2. User Applications

User Applications table holds the information regarding an application that is activated for a client.

```python
    class UserApplication(db.Model):

        __tablename__ = "user_application"

        # Application indentifiers
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
        client_prefix = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
        app_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("master_application.id"))
        active = db.Column(db.BOOLEAN, nullable=True, default=True)

        subscription_key = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=True)
        is_recurring_payment = db.Column(db.BOOLEAN, nullable=True, default=False)

        units_remaining = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=True)
        activated_units = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=True)
        recurring_period = db.Column(db.INTEGER, nullable=True)
        recurring_price = db.Column(db.FLOAT, nullable=True)

        trial_taken = db.Column(db.BOOLEAN, nullable=True)
        is_trial = db.Column(db.BOOLEAN, nullable=True)

        configuration = db.Column(JSON)

        expiry_date = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=True)
        activated_on = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.now)

        __table_args__ = (db.UniqueConstraint("app_id", "client_prefix", name="fld_idx_ord_unique"),)
```

There are some structural problems and redundancy in the table. The columns `activated_units`, `recurring_period`, `recurring_price` are redundant as they will be available
in the subscription details of the master application. The structural problems are with how the date columns are named. Here is the new structure addressing the issues:

```python
    class UserApplication(db.Model):

        __tablename__ = "user_application"

        # Application indentifiers
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
        client_prefix = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
        app_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("master_application.id"))
        active = db.Column(db.BOOLEAN, nullable=True, default=True)

        subscription_key = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=True)
        is_recurring_payment = db.Column(db.BOOLEAN, nullable=True, default=False)

        units_remaining = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=True)
        trial_taken = db.Column(db.BOOLEAN, nullable=True)
        is_trial = db.Column(db.BOOLEAN, nullable=True)

        configuration = db.Column(JSON)

        date_expiry = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=True)
        date_created = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.now)
        date_updated = db.Column(db.DateTime, onupdate=datetime.now)


        __table_args__ = (db.UniqueConstraint("app_id", "client_prefix", name="fld_idx_ord_unique"),)
```

## 3. User Application History

In the current app store system, the `user_application_history` table serves the purpose of having a record of the purchase history for the client. This is the same behaviour that
the `transactions_ledger` table shows when it comes to the billing system. This means, when the `application_costs_sub_ledger` is being developed this table can be completely removed
and be replaced with a `transactions_ledger` entry, corresponding to that particular sub ledger entry.

Anyway, the current structure of the table is as follows:

```python
class UserApplicationHistory(db.Model):

    __tablename__ = "user_application_history"

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
    client_prefix = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)

    app_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("master_application.id"))
    units_remaining = db.Column(db.INTEGER, nullable=True)

    created_date = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.now)
    deducted_amount = db.Column(db.FLOAT, nullable=True)
    activation_date = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=False)
    expiry_date = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=True)

    subscription_key = db.Column(db.Integer)
    recurring_period = db.Column(db.INTEGER, nullable=True)
    recurring_price = db.Column(db.FLOAT, nullable=True)

    username = db.Column(db.String, nullable=True)
    status = db.Column(db.String, nullable=True)
    reason = db.Column(db.String, nullable=True)
```

Here also some data is redundant and the date columns are not named properly. The new structure of the table will be:

```python
class UserApplicationHistory(db.Model):

    __tablename__ = "user_application_history"

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
    client_prefix = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)

    app_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("master_application.id"))
    units_remaining = db.Column(db.INTEGER, nullable=True)

    deducted_amount = db.Column(db.FLOAT, nullable=True)

    subscription_key = db.Column(db.Integer)
    username = db.Column(db.String, nullable=True)
    status = db.Column(db.String, nullable=True)
    reason = db.Column(db.String, nullable=True)

    date_activation = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=False)
    date_expiry = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=True)
    date_created = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.now)
    date_updated = db.Column(db.DateTime, onupdate=datetime.now)
```

# Notifications Engine

## 1. Fixing app store related templates

The app store related templates are not named properly and are not standardized. Let's see all
the required templates and fix them one by one.

So a wareiq application has the following actions that can be triggered:

1. `activate` (API)
2. `deactivate` (API, Task)
3. `renew` (API, Task)
4. `upgrade` (API)
5. `downgrade` (API,Task)

Each of these actions will have a corresponding template that will be sent to the client. The templates are:

1. Activation

When a client activates an application for the first time, if its a trial or a paid subscription, the client will receive a notification that the application has been activated.

So this template has 2 scenarios:

- Trial activation `client_app_trial_activation_success`
- Paid activation `client_app_activation_success`

The relevant information for this email will include the following according to the scenario:

- Trial activation
  - App name
  - App description
  - App thumbnail
  - App icon
  - Activation date
  - Expiry date
  - Remaining units
- Paid activation
  - App name
  - App description
  - App thumbnail
  - App icon
  - Activation date
  - Expiry date
  - Remaining units
  - Amount paid
  - GST amount
  - Total amount

2. Deactivation

When a client deactivates an application, the client will receive a notification that the application has been deactivated.

This operation can be done by the client or by the system. So the template has 2 scenarios:

- Client deactivation `client_app_deactivation_success` (When the client turns of the recurring payment)
- System deactivation `client_app_wiq_deactivation_success` (When the system deactivates the application)

In the email template the messaging should signify how the deactivation was done. If the deactivation was done by the client, the email should say that the client has deactivated the application. If the deactivation was done by the system, the email should say that the application has been deactivated by the system.

3. Renewal

Renewal of the application is done at expiry by the background job. When the application is renewed, the client will receive a notification that the application has been renewed.

- System renewal `client_app_wiq_renewal_success` (When the system renews the application)

4. Upgrade

When a client purchases an application upgrade, for both `credit_based` and `duration_based` applications, the client will recieve one single
notification that the application has been upgraded.

- Upgrade successful `client_app_upgrade_success`

5. Downgrade

When a client purchases a downgrade for an application, the client will receive a notification that the purchase for the downgrade has been successful. For `duration_based` applications, the client will receive a notification that the application has been scheduled for a downgrade. Since there is a difference in the downgrade process for `duration_based` applications, the template has 2 scenarios:

- Downgrade initiated `client_app_downgrade_initiated`
- Downgrade successful `client_app_downgrade_success`

# Frontend changes

## Getting all the master applications

Sending a `GET` request to the `[track.wareiq.com/apps/v1/list`](http://track.wareiq.com/apps/v1/list%60) endpoint will return all the master applications.

```bash

curl --location 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/apps/v1/list' \

--header 'authorization: Bearer <token>'

```

## Getting all the user applications

Sending a `GET` request to the `[track.wareiq.com/apps/v1/user_application`](http://track.wareiq.com/apps/v1/user_application%60) endpoint will return all the user applications.

```bash

curl --location 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/apps/v1/user_application' \

--header 'authorization: Bearer <token>' \

--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

--data '{}'

```

## Creating an user application

Sending a `POST` request to the `[track.wareiq.com/apps/v1/user_application`](http://track.wareiq.com/apps/v1/user_application%60) endpoint with action as `activate` and that will activate the app for the client.

```bash

curl --location --request POST 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/apps/v1/user_application' \

--header 'authorization: Bearer <token>' \

--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

--data '{

    "action": "activate",

    "app_id": 1016,

    "subscription_id": 1, // Optional, if its a free application

    "is_recurring_payment": false

}'

```

## Updating an user application

Sending a `PATCH` request to the `[track.wareiq.com/apps/v1/user_application`](http://track.wareiq.com/apps/v1/user_application%60) endpoint with necessary payload will activate the app for the client. The action can be `deactivate`, `upgrade`, or `downgrade`.

### App Deactivation

```bash

curl --location --request PATCH 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/apps/v1/user_application' \

--header 'authorization: Bearer <token>' \

--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

--data '{

    "action": "deactivate",

    "app_id": 1016,

}'

```

### App Upgrade

```bash

curl --location --request PATCH 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/apps/v1/user_application' \

--header 'authorization: Bearer <token>' \

--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

--data '{

    "action": "upgrade",

    "app_id": 1016,

    "subscription_id": 1, // Id of the subscription that the client wants to upgrade to

    "is_recurring_payment": false

}'

```

### App Downgrade

```bash

curl --location --request PATCH 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/apps/v1/user_application' \

--header 'authorization: Bearer <token>' \

--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

--data '{

    "action": "downgrade",

    "app_id": 1016,

    "subscription_id": 1, // Id of the subscription that the client wants to downgrade to

    "is_recurring_payment": false

}'

```

NOTE: For credit based applications downgrade happens immediately. For duration based applications the downgrade is a rollover downgrade.

## User Application Configuration

Currently there is 2 ways to update the user application configuration.

`apps/v1/config` - Used internally by shipping badges app

`apps/v1/user_application/config` - Used by webapp

Now, there is only 1 API to do the same `apps/v1/user_application/config`. This API differs in functionality based on the method used to call it

POST - Updates the configuration for the user application (generic api to update the configuration)

GET - Fetches the configuration for the user application (specific for shipping badges)

PATCH - Updates the configuration for the user application (specific for shipping badges)

```bash

curl --location 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/apps/v1/user_application/config' \

--header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE3MzQyNTI0MTEsImlhdCI6MTczMzk5MzIxMSwic3ViIjo0NDU4fQ.H3BOgvTckzkmF9sLK5Z0McKhq-VrltdudGDntMFP5mk' \

--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

--data '{

    "client_prefix": "suryan", // Required

    "app_id": 1016, // Required

    "configuration": {

        "wiq": {

            "tier": "Platinum",

            "type": "Shipping"

        },

        "store_url": "hehe"

    }

}'

```
